## SYNC packet bytes 5-6: NOT summer limit (issue #38)

Tested whether SYNC byte 5 tracks summer limit temperature.

**Data:** 4 SYNC packets across 3 connections (Feb 11-12):

| Connection | Summer Limit | Byte 5 | Byte 6 |
|------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Feb 11 14:07 | 26°C | 0x1a | 0x02 |
| Feb 12 11:50 | 26°C | 0x1a | 0x02 |
| Feb 12 14:39* | 24→29→26°C | (no SYNC — changes mid-connection) | |
| Feb 12 15:40 | 24°C | 0x1a | 0x02 |

*Summer limit changes sent via REQUEST param 0x17 (confirmed in btsnoop).

**Conclusion:** Byte 5 = 0x1a is constant regardless of summer limit setting.
The correlation with 26°C was coincidental. Bytes 5-6 purpose remains unknown.

## SYNC frequency correction

SYNC (0x1a) is sent **once per connection**, immediately after the initial
handshake. Across all sessions, exactly one SYNC per connection was observed.
The "every ~10s" pattern is from REQUEST polling, not SYNC. Corrected in
protocol.md §7.1.
