# 2026-02-09: Post-#26 follow-up (issues #19, #6, #5)

## Environment check

- Confirmed ADB endpoint is reachable: `192.168.1.160:38087`
- `adb connect` succeeds and `adb shell wm size` responds
- `vmictl.py battery` works (55%)

## #19 humidity validation attempt

Tried running a fresh checkpoint capture session after merge #26.

Observed blocker:
- UI dumps show `com.android.systemui` keyguard/lockscreen as top window
- `vmictl` navigation commands that require app selectors can stall while waiting for elements when device is locked

Action taken:
- Added `scripts/capture/preflight_capture.py` to check connectivity + keyguard state before running long capture flows
- Added issue #19 runbook in `docs/reverse-engineering/playbook.md` with explicit per-step checkpoints and extraction commands

## #6 night ventilation decoding

Action taken:
- Added concrete runbook (3-run method, delayed checkpoint at +15s, extraction commands) in playbook
- Includes `analyze_settings_packets.py` post-processing step for candidate packet path detection

## #5 bypass state (weather-dependent)

Action taken:
- Added practical capture plan/checklist in playbook focused on observational checkpoints only (no risky writes)
- Added structured worksheet guidance to correlate icon state, weather, and candidate status bytes

## Notes

No risky device writes were performed in this session.
