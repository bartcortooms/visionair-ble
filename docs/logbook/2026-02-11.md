# 2026-02-11: Issue #37 — Decode byte 60 in DEVICE_STATE

## Capture mining results

Analyzed all 62 btsnoop captures to correlate B[57] and B[60] with known fields.

### Byte 57: polling context indicator

B[57] cycles during each 10s polling burst:
- 28, 25 (FULL_DATA_Q response, ~200ms apart)
- 11 (DEVICE_STATE_Q response, ~10s later)
- Rare: 1 (with B[58]=107), 0, 100

### Byte 60: live computed value

Responds to:
- **Mode transitions** (instant): different per-mode ranges
- **Preheat toggle** (~17 units in LOW): ON=63, OFF=46 (Feb 6 data)
- **Unknown internal state** (~150 unit step): Feb 5 21:20 B60=212 → 22:39 B60=55,
  with all decoded fields constant (preheat, boost, holiday, temps, humidity unchanged)

### Cross-session summary (B[57]=11, LOW mode)

Feb 3: 210 (preheat OFF) | Feb 4: 208-215 (preheat ON) | Feb 5 pre-22:00: 209-212 |
Feb 5 post-22:00: 55-63 | Feb 6-7: 46-63 | Feb 8-9: 59

### What B[60] is NOT

- Not a direct humidity reading (values >100)
- Not airflow in m3/h (expected values 131/163/200 don't match)
- Not purely a function of preheat state (transition happened while preheat=ON constant)
- Not a function of remote temperature or humidity (SCHEDULE byte 11/13 constant)

### Hypotheses (ranked)

1. **Motor duty cycle or PWM value** — instant mode response + slow drift fits a control
   loop. The big transition could be the schedule switching between day/night duty cycles.
2. **Heat exchanger parameter** (efficiency, bypass position) — drifts with environment,
   responds to fan speed. But efficiency should be 0-100%, values exceed that.
3. **Multiplexed measurement register** — B[57] selects what B[60] reports. Different
   B[57] values give different B[60] ranges because they're different physical quantities.

## Blockers

Phone (Fairphone) unreachable — likely dead battery. VMI not advertising (phone app may
hold connection). Cannot do live app correlation until phone is charged.
